# What is this?

The **Roblox Downgrader** is an open-source downgrader for Roblox. It is intended for <a href="https://krampus.gg/">Krampus</a> users when Roblox updated, but Krampus hasn't.

Currently it **only** works for the Roblox Player, but that might change in the future. <a href="https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/">Bloxstrap</a> is needed for it to work!

# Features
* Revert to older versions of Roblox Player
* that's it, what did u expect?

# ANTI-VIRUS DISCLAIMER

If you have an anti-virus program installed, there's a non-zero chance it may flag this program as malicious, due to this application being misdiagnosed as a trojan horse.<br/>

It was flagged as such because it downloads builds of Roblox from a remote location and executes them on your PC. Since anti-virus programs can't distinguish whether this is malicious or not, it chooses to take no chances and assume it is malicious.<br/>

If your Anti-Virus automatically deletes the Downgrader, you can add an exclusion in your Anti-Virus. <a href="https://twitter.com/BoatbomberRBLX">boatbomber</a> made a <a href="https://twitter.com/BoatbomberRBLX/status/1347262909915738113">tutorial</a> on how to do it :)
