# What is this?

The **Roblox Downgrader** is an open-source downgrader for Roblox. It is intended for exploiters when Roblox updated, but the executor you're using hasn't.

Currently it **only** works for the Roblox Player, but i **might** add support for Roblox Studio ([Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) exists already). <a href="https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/">Bloxstrap</a> is needed for it to work!

# Features
* Revert to older versions of the Roblox Player!
* that's it, what did you expect?

# DISCLAIMER

## THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH CELERY.

## BAN-WAVE

If you do not want to get banned, don't use this or any executors at all. There is always a ban risk involved down grading and using an executor. I do **NOT** take responsibility for any bans. So far I did not see anyone getting banned because of **this** software, but that might change in the future.

## ANTI-VIRUS

If you have an anti-virus program installed, there's a non-zero chance it may flag this program as malicious, due to this application being misdiagnosed as a trojan horse.<br/>

It was flagged as such because it downloads builds of Roblox from a remote location and executes them on your PC. Since anti-virus programs can't distinguish whether this is malicious or not, it chooses to take no chances and assume it is malicious.<br/>

If your Anti-Virus automatically deletes the Downgrader, you can add an exclusion in your Anti-Virus. <a href="https://twitter.com/BoatbomberRBLX">boatbomber</a> made a <a href="https://twitter.com/BoatbomberRBLX/status/1347262909915738113">tutorial</a> on how to do it :)

A [Virus Total analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a5df226a516fdd4e00e8b49416f21700f307d22aa0aec5cbda1134a66a935d9e) of Version `v2024.04.28` ([release](https://github.com/ActualMasterOogway/Roblox-Downgrader/releases/tag/v2024.04.28)) has been done with 2 [false positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives)
